    my favorite game is called <strong>Red <u>dead</u> redemption</strong> and this game gave me a life experience to me
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target="_blank" title="HTML">red Dead Redemption 2</a> is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games.
    <p>The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and is a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption.</p>
    <img src="sun.jpg" width="200$">
    <p>The story is set in 1899 in a fictionalized representation of the Western, Midwestern and Southern United States and follows outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang.</P>

    Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries.
    The story also follows fellow gang member John Marston, the protagonist of Red Dead Redemption.
    The game is presented through both first and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open world.
    Gameplay elements include shootouts, heists, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters (NPCs), and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds.
    A bounty system similar to the "wanted" system from the Grand Theft Auto franchise governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player.
    Red Dead Redemption 2 was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in October 2018, and for Microsoft Windows and Stadia in November 2019.
    Red Dead Online, the online multiplayer mode of the game, was released as a beta version in November 2018 before a full release in May 2019.
